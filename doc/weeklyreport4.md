# Week 4

## What was done
Started working on an automated tool for performance testing. The tool runs compression
and decompression using the different algorithms and different files. After each run,
the time used, compression ratio and success/failure is saved, and ultimately combined into
algorithm specific csv files.

## What I learned
As I did not really work on the core functionality of the project, there was nothing new to
really learn. Just routine programming for performance testing the algorithms.

## What's next
The performance testing tool's output will be improved so that hopefully graphs and
tables can be autogenerated for the testing documentation.

I will also start working on the testing documentation and improve the implementation
documentation.

## What has been problematic
Nothing really problematic, but I did manage to catch a few bugs in both algorithms
when implementing the performance testing tool.
