# Week 4

## What was done
Started working on an automated tool for performance testing. The tool runs compression
and decompression using the different algorithms and different files. After each run,
the time used, compression ratio and success/failure is printed.

## What I learned

## What's next
The performance testing tool's output will be improved to be properly parseable
so that comparison charts/tables can be generated from it.

## What has been problematic
Nothing really problematic, but I did manage to catch a few bugs in both algorithms
when implementing the performance testing tool.

## Time used
