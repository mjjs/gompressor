# Week 5

## What was done
During this week I implemented a small UI for the application just for fun and
profit. I had quite a busy week, so not much work has been put to this project.
Most of the time I spent this week was reading the project I had to review.

## What I learned
Thanks to the code review, I learned about Knuth's Algorithm X.

## What's next
I will try to finish the testing and implementation documentations.
