# Week 6

## What was done
Nothing major has been going on in the codebase itself this week. Mostly little
fixes and so on. Most of the time has been spent working on the documentation.

## What I learned
I had to bring back to mind how to use python to generate charts.

## What's next
Continuing to write documentation and finishing the project up.
