# Week 3

## What was done
During week three, I have implemented the first draft of the Huffman coding algorithm. The encoding and decoding works, but the resulting, compressed file is about ten times larger than the original file.

## What I learned
I feel like I understand the Huffman coding algorithm fairly well now. After reading about it and implementing it, turns out it is quite simple in practice.

## What's next
The next goal is to modify the Huffman compression so that the resulting file is actually smaller than the original.
I have actually implemented this already, but the code is not merged yet into master because I still need to refactor
the decompression algorithm to work with the new implementation.

## What has been problematic
This week was pretty straightforward with no major problems that come into mind at the time of writing this.
