# Week 1

## What was done
This week started by choosing the topic of the project as well as the programming language. The project specification document has been written and included in this repository.
I also wrote the first implementation of the LZW encoding/decoding algorithms using standard library data structures.

## What I learned
I actually had no prior experience about compression algorithms (apart from the names of some of the most used algorithms), which was a major contributing factor when choosing this topic. I feel like I have a good basic understanding about the LZW algorithm after reading about it.

## What's next
I will most likely start implementing the data structures used by the LZW compression and decompression. This should be fairly straightforward, so I should have time after that to start researching the Huffman coding more deeply.

## What has been problematic
So far nothing has been problematic. The course assistant answered my question about the programming language to use very swiftly, so I could get to work right away.
