# Week 1

## What was done
This week started by choosing the topic of the project as well as the programming language. The project specification document has been written and included in this repository.
I also wrote the first implementation of the LZW encoding/decoding algorithms using standard library data structures. The compressed files seem to be larger than the original file, though.

## What I learned
I actually had no prior experience about compression algorithms (apart from the names of some of the most used algorithms), which was a major contributing factor when choosing this topic. I feel like I have a good basic understanding about the LZM algorithm after reading about it.

## What's next
I will most likely continue working with the LZM algorithm and try go get it to actually compress data instead of just encode it as integer codes.

## What has been problematic
So far nothing has been problematic. The course assistant answered my question about the programming language to use very swiftly, so I could get to work right away.
